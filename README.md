## Introduction to Spring HATEOAS
Spring HATEOAS is a library that helps you implement HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) for RESTful services built with Spring. 
It allows clients interacting with the API to discover and navigate through available actions dynamically.

### Key Features and Usage
Spring HATEOAS simplifies the creation of hypermedia-driven RESTful services in Spring applications. 
It provides several key features:

#### Resource Assemblers: 
Spring HATEOAS has resource assemblers that ease the creation of Resource objects that contain links to related resources. These assemblers help in dynamically adding hypermedia links to resources returned by your controllers.

#### Link Creation: 
This library provides utilities to create links between resources based on the relationships between them. These links help clients navigate the API by providing information on available actions and related resources.

#### Controller Support: 
Spring HATEOAS integrates seamlessly with Spring MVC controllers, allowing you to return Resource objects from your controller methods. These Resource objects encapsulate the primary data along with hypermedia links.

### Getting Started
To start using Spring HATEOAS in your project, include the dependency in your Maven or Gradle build file:

#### Maven:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.hateoas</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-hateoas</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle:
```
implementation 'org.springframework.hateoas:spring-hateoas:1.4.0' // Use the latest version
```
